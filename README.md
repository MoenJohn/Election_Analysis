# Election Analysis
This is an analysis of election results 

## Overview of Election Audit: Explain the purpose of this election audit analysis.
This election audit analysis was requested by the election commission, originaly to review a database of all votes and review which candidate had the most votes, and was later expanded to include voter turnouts by county as well. To do this I used a python script to read the contents of a voter results csv file, extract and analyze the relevent information inside, and write the results to an output file. With the information provided we can asses the number of total votes, votes by county, and candidate vote percentages and totals, all of which are detailed below. The raw election results file is kept in the _Resources_ directory, while the output or final analysis is written to the _analysis_ directory. 


## Election-Audit Results: 
Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.

* How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
* 
* Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
* Which county had the largest number of votes?
* Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
* Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?

# Election-Audit Summary: 
In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
